In Google's Recipe schema property definitions, the `recipeIngredient` value
_should_ always be a `Text` array. Unfortunatly, the `recipeInstructions` specs are
not so simple. The value for the `recipeInstructions` property can be an array of type
`HowToStep`, `HowToSection`, or `Text`.

The `HowToStep` type is an object and also what the previous example used. We want to
extract the `text` key from each of these and put them into an array.

```go
instructions := []string{}
for _, step := range r.jsonld.RecipeInstructions {
    if step["text"] != "" {
        instructions = append(instructions, step["text"])
    }
}
```

The `HowToSection` type is a collection of `HowToStep`s. For example, a pizza
recipe may have one section of steps for making the crust, one for preparing the
toppings, and one for combining and baking.

```json
{
  "@type": "HowToSection",
  "name": "Assemble the pie",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate."
    }, {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Top with second crust. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust."
    }
  ]
}
```

This type differs from our existing type definition because not all values will
be `string`, the `itemListElement` property will contain an array of `HowToStep`s.

```go

```
