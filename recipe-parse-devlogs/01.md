The relevant keys here are `recipeIngredient` and `recipeInstructions`. Lukily
in this example, `recipeIngredient` is already in our desired format (a string
array). The `recipeInstructions`, however are not so nicely formatted. This key
contains an array of `HowToStep` objects. The desired instructions data are in
these objects' `text` keys.

I can use the following go struct to define the types of these keys (plus the
key containig the name of the recipe)...

```go
type RecipeJsonld struct {
	Name               string              `json:"name"`
	RecipeIngredient   []string            `json:"recipeIngredient"`
	RecipeInstructions []map[string]string `json:"recipeInstructions"`
}
```

and decode the jsonld blob into this struct. 

```go
var m RecipeJsonld
err := json.Unmarshal(b, &m)
```

The questions is, will this work for all cases?

The only required properties in Google's specs are `image` and `name` so I will
need to gracefully handel cases where `recipeIngredient` or `recipeInstructions`
are missing.

Google lists the [Recipe Schema Definition](https://schema.org/Recipe) as a
guideline for the values that can be used.
