The idea behind this program is to extract recipe data from a jsonld blob
based on the [Google Recipe specification](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe).

Ultimately, the output of this tool will be used to find the locations of the
recipe in the content of the page. Hopefully the ingredients and instructions
will match up between the jsonld and content sources so this can be a simple
text search. This could serve as a "ground truth" for an ML model.

Lets not get too ahead of ourselves though. First things first, we need to set
up the high level IO for this tool. My initial thought is to accept a stream of
jsonld text and return the recipe data as 2 string lists: one for ingredients
and one for instructions.

The jsonld will be sourced from a recipe website's html so, eventually, we will
need to parse html but lets keep things simple for now and focus on parsing the
jsonld.
